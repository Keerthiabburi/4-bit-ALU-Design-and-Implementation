# 4-bit ALU Design and Implementation

## üìò Project Concept

The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is a central component in digital processors, responsible for executing arithmetic and logic operations. This project involves designing a **4-bit ALU** capable of performing the following operations:
- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Bitwise XOR**
- **Bitwise NOT**

The ALU uses a **Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA)** for arithmetic operations and basic combinational logic for logical functions. A **multiplexer-based selector** chooses the correct output based on a 2-bit control signal.

The objective was to realize this design both in **behavioral form (RTL)** and **physical form (transistor-level)** to bridge high-level abstraction with low-level circuit implementation ‚Äî a key learning goal in VLSI design.
